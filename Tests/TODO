List of tests

Rocket tests
  Given a rocket file, plot all rocket quantities and see if they are reasonable

Forces tests
  Given a trajectory, find the forces at each time step and plot them.
  See if the results are reasonable

Trajectory tests
  Check rotation matrices
  Check matrix multiplications. Change to @
  check initialInclination
  check initialQuaternion
  Check N, the length of the simulation intervals
  Are the lengths of the arrays right?

Simulator tests
  One general test
  Plot all results
  See if they are reasonable
