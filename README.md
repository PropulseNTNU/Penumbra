# Penumbra
An original rocket simulator developed by the simulation group at Propulse NTNU (TEAM 2019).

Prerequisites to use simulator:
* Python packages:
	- Scipy
	- Numpy
	- Matplotlib
* Python version >= 3.0

Penumbra is a simulation tool used to calculate the time evolution of rocket characteristics during flight, and to predict rocket trajectories. The simulator is developed with the aim to optimize flight performance, consistent with the rules posed by the IREC Spaceport America Cup.
